Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.

You need to to create a mysql database which will have only one table named customer_data. The customer_data table will have 4 columns: name, email, phone and id (auto increment)

You need to create the mysql database and 4 nodejs apis:
1. Create API: posting data to this api will create a record in mysql 
Sample json post will include: name, email, phone

2. Delete API: posting data to this api will delete a record in mysql 
Sample json post we will pass just email and it should search for that email address in database and delete that entry

3. Search API: posting data to this api will search for a record in mysql  
Sample json post we will pass just email and it should search for that email address in database and return that entry

Let me know if you've any questions

Thanks,
Gaurav
